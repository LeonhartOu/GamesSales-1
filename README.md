# Dataset 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kendallgillies/video-game-sales-and-ratings)
> I used the "Video Game Sales with Ratings" dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains a comprehensive list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies.

# Tools:
- Python (Programming Language)
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)
- NumPy (Numerical Operations)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data Visualization)

# The Process
1. Data Cleaning:
- Handle missing values appropriately, by dropping them.
- Check for any duplicate rows and remove them.
- Converting data types to the correct data form.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Perform basic statistical analysis to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
- Identify the top 10 best-selling games of all time.
- Analyze the distribution of games across different platforms and genres.

3. Data Visualization:
- Create a bar chart showing the number of games released per year.
- Use a pie chart to represent the market share of different gaming platforms.

# Summary:
- The video game industry has seen fluctuating sales over the years, with peak sales occurring in the late 2000s.
- Action and Sports genres dominate the market in terms of global sales.
- Electronic Arts is the Publisher with the highest Sales so far.
